### 2. **Scalability Architecture**
**Research Focus**: Handling multiple concurrent vehicles and users
- Firebase Firestore scaling limits and pricing
- Real-time database connection limits
- Geographic data indexing strategies
- Load balancing for high-traffic scenarios[14][15]

**Investigation Points**:
- Microservices architecture with Cloud Functions
- Database sharding strategies for location data
- CDN implementation for global access
- Auto-scaling policies for varying loads

### 3. **Security and Privacy**
**Research Focus**: Data protection and access control
- Location data encryption in transit and at rest
- User authentication and authorization models
- GDPR compliance for location tracking
- Secure API endpoint design[16][4]

**Investigation Points**:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive location data
- Role-based access control implementation
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Audit logging for compliance

### 4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
**Research Focus**: Flutter web vs mobile experience
- Performance differences between platforms
- Feature parity across web and mobile
- Responsive design patterns for vehicle tracking
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities[17][18]

**Investigation Points**:
- Flutter web rendering performance for maps
- Touch vs mouse interaction patterns
- Offline functionality differences
- Browser-specific limitations and workarounds

### 5. **Integration Complexity**
**Research Focus**: Third-party service integration
- Google Maps API rate limits and costs
- Firebase pricing models and usage optimization
- Real-time communication protocols comparison
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies

**Investigation Points**:
- Alternative mapping services evaluation
- Cost optimization strategies for high-usage scenarios
- Service redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Data export and migration capabilities

## Implementation Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Implement clean architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns[19][20]
- Use repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Apply MVVM architecture for UI state management
- Create shared packages for common functionality between mobile and web

### State Management
- Utilize Provider or Riverpod for state management
- Implement real-time stream subscriptions efficiently
- Use proper error handling and loading states
- Maintain offline state synchronization[21][22]

### Performance Guidelines
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Use efficient map rendering techniques
- Optimize location update frequencies
- Cache frequently accessed data locally[23][24]
