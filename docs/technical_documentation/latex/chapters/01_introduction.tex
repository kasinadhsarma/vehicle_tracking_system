\section{Project Background}
\label{sec:project_background}

The transportation and logistics industry has experienced unprecedented growth, driven by e-commerce expansion and globalization. Traditional vehicle tracking methods have proven inadequate for modern business requirements, necessitating intelligent, real-time solutions that can adapt to dynamic operational needs.

\subsection{Market Context}
The global vehicle tracking system market, valued at USD 2.94 billion in 2022, is projected to reach USD 6.04 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 9.4\% during the forecast period \cite{market_research_2023}. This growth is attributed to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing demand for fleet optimization and fuel cost reduction
    \item Growing emphasis on driver safety and behavior monitoring
    \item Rising adoption of IoT and cloud-based solutions
    \item Regulatory requirements for commercial vehicle monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technology Evolution}
The evolution of mobile technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for developing sophisticated tracking solutions:

    \label{tab:tech_evolution}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Generation} & \textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Capabilities} & \textbf{Limitations} \\
        \midrule
        1st Gen & GPS + GSM & Basic location tracking & High latency, limited features \\
        2nd Gen & GPS + 3G & Real-time updates & Expensive, complex integration \\
        3rd Gen & Smartphone-based & Multi-platform apps & Battery dependency \\
        4th Gen & Cloud-native & Real-time analytics & Requires internet connectivity \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Problem Domain}
\label{sec:problem_domain}

The transportation and logistics industry confronts several critical challenges that traditional tracking systems fail to address adequately:

\subsection{Operational Inefficiencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Limited Real-time Visibility}: Traditional systems provide updates with significant delays (5-15 minutes), hindering real-time decision making.
    \item \textbf{Fragmented Data Systems}: Multiple disconnected platforms create operational silos and increase administrative overhead.
    \item \textbf{Poor Route Optimization}: Manual route planning leads to increased fuel consumption and delivery delays.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints}: Legacy systems struggle with growing fleet sizes and increasing data volumes.
    \item \textbf{Integration Challenges}: Limited API access and poor documentation complicate system integration.
    \item \textbf{Mobile User Experience}: Most solutions prioritize web interfaces over mobile optimization.
\end{enumerate}

    return Geolocator.getPositionStream(
      locationSettings: LocationSettings(
        accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
        distanceFilter: 10, // meters
        timeLimit: _updateInterval,
      ),
    );
  }
  
  Future<void> updateRealtimeLocation(
    String vehicleId, 
    LocationModel location
  ) async {
    await FirebaseDatabase.instance
        .ref('live_tracking/$vehicleId')
        .set({
      'latitude': location.latitude,
      'longitude': location.longitude,
      'timestamp': ServerValue.timestamp,
